      What change in behaviour did 14-year-old Amy describe after the social media ban?
She does other things on her phone but uses social media a bit less than before.

What reasons did the Australian government give for introducing the ban on under-16s using social media?
To protect young people from harmful interactions and bullying on the internet.

How does the teenager Aahil’s experience differ from Amy’s?
He created new accounts on social media platforms using a false age to bypass the age restriction.

What are some ways young people have tried to continue accessing social media despite the ban?
By making new accounts with incorrect ages or using VPNs.

Do you think the ban will help teenagers develop healthier offline habits? Why or why not?
Yes, because they have more time to do other activities and join clubs to socialise.

Do you agree with the government’s approach to tackling online addiction by enforcing a legal ban? What alternatives could be considered? Would such a ban be a good thing in Switzerland?
I think it is a good start, but not a very effective solution because it is far too easy to bypass the restrictions, which makes them largely ineffective.
