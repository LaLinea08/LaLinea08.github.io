      <p><strong>What change in behaviour did 14-year-old Amy describe after the social media ban?</strong><br>
  She does other things on her phone but uses social media a bit less than before.</p>

  <p><strong>What reasons did the Australian government give for introducing the ban on under-16s using social media?</strong><br>
  To protect young people from harmful interactions and bullying on the internet.</p>

  <p><strong>How does the teenager Aahil’s experience differ from Amy’s?</strong><br>
  He created new accounts on social media platforms using a false age to bypass the age restriction.</p>

  <p><strong>What are some ways young people have tried to continue accessing social media despite the ban?</strong><br>
  By making new accounts with incorrect ages or using VPNs.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you think the ban will help teenagers develop healthier offline habits? Why or why not?</strong><br>
  Yes, because they have more time to do other activities and join clubs to socialise.</p>

  <p><strong>Do you agree with the government’s approach to tackling online addiction by enforcing a legal ban? Would such a ban be a good thing in Switzerland?</strong><br>
  I think it is a good start, but not a very effective solution because it is far too easy to bypass the restrictions.</p>
